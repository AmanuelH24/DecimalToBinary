# What is Decimal Number System?

Decimal number system is what we use in our day to day life.

Also, known as base of 10 and uses 10 symbols. 

**Which are, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9**

Decimal number system also uses decimal points to represnet deciaml fractions. For example if we take 25 as a decimal number, 2 is ten times more than 5.

# What is the Binary number system?

The Binary number system is numbering scheme in which there are only two possible values for each digit. 

So, the number system is known as base 2 in which numbers are represented by 0 and 1.

Binary numbers are mostly used in computers for programming and coding because computers can only understand the language of binary digits. 

**Which are, 0, 1

The smallest unit of data in computer is called a bit and it is taken from binary digit. The bit all the way to the left is called Most Significant Bit and all the way to the right is called the Least Significant Bit. 

# Convert Decimal to Binary 

To convert Decimal to Binary we take the given decimal number and divide it repeatedly by 2 untill the remainders are down to 0.

**Here is a step by step process**

Step 1: Divied the given decimal number by 2 and write down the reminder. 

Step 2: Now divied the answer you got from the top by 2 again and write down the reminder. 

Step 3: Repeat the above steps until you get 0 as the final answer.

Step 4: Write the remainders in reverse order starting from last remainder written first and the first remainder last. 

# Decimal to Binary Conversion Example 

* 19 / 2 = 9 Remainder 1 (Least Significant Bit) 
* 9  / 2 = 4 Remainder 1
* 4  / 2 = 2 Remainder 0
* 2  / 2 = 1 Remainder 0
* 1  / 2 = 0 Remainder 1 (Most Significant Bit) 

*Now we will write the remainder in reverse oreder 10011 

So, the decimal number 19 is converted to the binary number 10011
